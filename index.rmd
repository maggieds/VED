<img src="vedb-logo.png" width="25%" alt="VED logo of drawing of an eye with a camera in the pupil" align="left" />The **Visual Experience Database (VEDB)** is a database of video captured from head-mounted cameras, complete with recordings of the videographerâ€™s eye movements taken by a diverse set of observers engaged in common, everyday activities such as shopping, eating, or walking.  By creating a database that represents common, human experiences, we bypass the many biases of extant datasets, with the aim of increasing the efficacy of computer vision algorithms.
