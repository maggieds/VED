The **Visual Experience Database (VED)** is a database of video captured from head-mounted cameras, complete with recordings of the videographerâ€™s eye movements taken by a diverse set of observers engaged in common, everyday activities such as shopping, eating, or walking.  By creating a database that represents common, human experiences, we bypass the many biases of extant datasets, with the aim of increasing the efficacy of computer vision algorithms.  

\

**The creation of the VED is supported by an NSF EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations grant (award #1920896).**
