## Volunteer to participate
We are seeking participants to assist with data collection.  Participation involves wearing a series of head-mounted cameras while performing an assigned common task such as shopping at a grocery store, making dinner, or taking a walk.  Participants are asked to commit approximately 3 hours to the process and will be compensated at a rate of $15/hr.  Complete the [Participant Application](link to form) to sign up to participate.
